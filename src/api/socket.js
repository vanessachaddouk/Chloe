// You need to set `window.navigator` to something in order to use the socket.io
// client. You have to do it like this in order to use the debugger because the
// debugger in React Native runs in a webworker and only has a getter method for
// `window.navigator`.
window.navigator.userAgent = 'ReactNative'

// Need to require instead of import so we can set the user agent first
// This must be below your `window.navigator` hack above
const io = require('socket.io-client/socket.io')
const socket = io('http://chat.feathersjs.com', {
  transports: ['websocket'] // you need to explicitly tell it to use websockets
})

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.warn('connected!')
})
